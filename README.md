Lazily open a leveldown compatible backend.

__NOTE:__ This doesn't work with levelup. This can only be useful to you if you're using leveldown directly.

## Example

```js
var lazy = require('level-lazy-open');
var down = require('leveldown');

// a function that returns an open backend
function factory(cb){
  var db = down('./db');
  db.open(function(err){
    cb(err, db);
  });
}

var db = lazy(factory);

// db is closed and won't be opened, unless
// you do something with it:

db.put('foo', 'bar', function(err){
  // db is open now

  // you can manually close the db again:
  db.close(function(err){
    // the end
  });
});
// db is opening now
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install level-lazy-open
```

## API

### lazy(factory)

Create a new [abstract-leveldown](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown)
compatible db that calls `factory` to get a db whenever it hasn't yet and you
perform an operation against it.
